# debian-domoticz
Docker image based on debian-slim

This docker image is based on Debian (buster-slim) and incorporates the toonapilib4domoticz plugin made by John van de Vrugt: https://github.com/JohnvandeVrugt/toonapilib4domoticz

To do's:

* Add user support (currently running as root) while being able to deal with User Namespaces setting in Docker

# installation

Clone the repository into a directory of your choosing:

`git clone https://github.com/bpmb82/debian-domoticz.git && cd debian-domoticz`

Then, build the image with Docker:

`docker build --no-cache --tag debian-domoticz:1.0 .`

This will tag the image as 'debian-domoticz:1.0'. You can choose another name if you wish.
Note down the id of the image once built, we need it in the next step.

Next, we run the image:

`docker container run -p 8080:8080 <id of image>`

You should now be able to login.

**NOTE**
If your docker container shows to be 'unhealthy', please add 127.0.0.* to the local networks in Domoticz -> Settings
